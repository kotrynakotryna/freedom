## FREEDOM, the irony

The project for the BSc Digital Arts Computing made using OpenFrameworks.
I was using ofxOpenCV to create a threshold that allowed me to load one video in the backgdround and another video inside the sillhouette of the person standing in front of the camera. 
The installation explored the ambiguity of the politics and irony of the freedom, that was an issue in the Soviet times but is still being noticed in the current society.

## Files to download

For the project to work you would need to download video and audio files from [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gcaf4ojrz7hwfjc/AACjClMdGUJJ_zSyAVS5k7YZa?dl=0)

The file contains the following:
* Two video files that are a part of the installation
* One audio file that was recorded as a background sound for the piece

To run the code it needs ofxOpenCv addon.
